# Thanks for reporting a bug!

Each feature in the extension is a plugin. It would be super helpful if you investigated
which plugin is causing the bug.

How can you do so? disable a feature and check if the bug still persists. If it does, disable
another one and check if the bug persists.

Once you disable a feature and the bug disappears, that's the feature with the bug!
